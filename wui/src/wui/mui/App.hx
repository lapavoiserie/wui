// backend installs a describer and *could* serve one. The networked corner
// stays off until the build asks for it with -D mui_cafos.

// Auxiliary is the extra windows, Commands the MenuBar injected as ordinary
// nodes; Companion rides the describer installed below.

        runs inside the render effect, the command thunks are re-sampled on
        every describe, and a label that reads state re-applies as a text prop
        like any other. One MenuBarItem per CommandSet declaration, titled from
        the set id — N menus, which SwiftUI's CommandsBuilder could not do.

        The chord crosses as one packed int (wui.mui.Chords); a chord outside
        the grammar keeps its item's label and click without an accelerator —
        Chords already said why, once. The Command.action closures ride the
