/**
	Describes a `mui` view tree as `nui` nodes.

	Lives in `wui` rather than in `mui`, because it is `wui` that needs it: push
	mode is what has to be handed a node tree, and `wui` is the only backend in
	push mode. It used to sit in `mui` behind `#if (mui_backend == "wui")` — the
	last conditional there, and the one that most obviously belonged elsewhere.

	## Why this exists

	`mui` had two shapes of application, and which one you wrote depended on the
	backend you were targeting — which is the one thing a layer like this exists
	to stop being true:

	- `body():View`, built from `mui.ui.*`, on sui, aui and cui.
	- `view():nui.Node`, built from `ui()` markup, on wui alone.

	An app written the first way compiled for wui and drew an empty window: the
	push renderer asks for `nuiBody()`, and `body()` was a stub nobody called.
	The kitchen sink — one source for four backends — could not run on the
	fourth.

	So the tree is *described* rather than rewritten. A `mui.ui.Button` on wui
	already **is** a `wui.ui.Button`, carrying a type name, properties and
	children; a `nui.Node` wants exactly those. This walks one and produces the
	other, which is what `nui` is for: the shared model both halves agree on.

	Markup stays available. An app that overrides `view()` is describing nodes
	directly and this is never reached.

	## Identity

	A node's key is its **place**, unless the view carries a `nodeId`. That is
	the rule the whole ecosystem settled on — see `wui.nui.Reconciler`, which
	explains what it costs to get wrong: without a key, "the text box they are
	typing in silently becomes a different one".

	/**
		Describe a bound cell as the two halves of a two-way control.

		A `wui.ui` control stores the cell it is bound to under `binding` and

		every state by name at compile time and pushes to it separately. On the
		push path it meant a control was **blind in both directions**: a switch
		bound to a cell holding `true` drew itself `Off`, and flipping it changed
		nothing in Haxe, so the line reading that cell never moved.

		Both halves are established here:

		- the cell's current value, under the property the control calls its
		  value, so a write in Haxe reaches the screen;
		- a handler under the key that control reports through, so an edit by the
		  user reaches the cell.

		Reading the cell here is what subscribes the render to it: `renderNui`
		runs this walk inside an effect, so `get()` makes the re-render happen by
		itself. That is the same rule the view layer follows everywhere else --
		a view reads observable state, and the reading is the subscription.
