/**
	What a control's *value* is called, and how it reports a change.

	## Why this is a table and not a convention

	A two-way control has one property that is its value, and one event that
	reports a new one. Neither is guessable: a switch calls it `isOn`, a field
	calls it `text`, a slider calls it `value`, and WinUI names their events
	after three unrelated things. A layer describing a view tree has to be told.

	## Why it lives in wui

	Because the names are WinRT's. `mui` describes a tree of views and should not
	have to know that a `ToggleSwitch` reports through `Toggled` — it asks here,
	and the answer stays next to the generator that emits the matching C++. Put
	the table in the describing layer instead and there would be two copies of
	one fact, free to drift in the direction that hurts: a control gaining an
	event nobody wired.

	## What a missing entry means

	`null`, and the caller says so. A control carrying a binding that nothing can
	deliver is a defect worth a message — silently dropping it is how a switch
	ends up showing `Off` while the cell it is bound to says `true`, which is
	precisely the bug this table was written to end.
