# Push mode

An app marked `@:nui` does not have its `body()` read at compile time. It runs,
describes itself as [`nui` nodes](https://lapavoiserie.github.io/nui/#/push-mode),
and a reconciler tells the WinUI side what changed. This page is about that
side — what a node becomes, where its children go, and how a control answers
back.

## What a node becomes

`wui.nui.Vocabulary` reads the `@:winuiType` and `@:winrt` annotations off
`wui.ui.*` and the generated `WuiNodes.cpp` is emitted from them. A control in
the vocabulary is a node type the sink can build; anything else is **refused at
compile time** by `wui.macros.PushCoverage`, which names the type and the file
to annotate.

That refusal is deliberate. A type the sink does not know could be drawn as
`?TabView` on screen — which is the right answer for a tree arriving as *data*,
and the wrong one for a `body()` written here and compiled for a known backend.
A knowable defect belongs in the build, not in a screenshot.

**A node reports its class name**, not its WinRT type. `wui.ui.Text` is the
documented exception, stated in its own source. `VStack` and `HStack` both used
to report `"StackPanel"`, and since every generated branch is keyed on the name
a node reports, the two collapsed onto one branch that could only carry one
orientation: every stack in the tree came out horizontal, and a screenful of
rows landed on a single line.

### A property this generator cannot spell is an error

`eachProp` used to skip a `@:winrt` field whose type it could not name, and
emit nothing for it. The Farceur session found what that costs: typing
`wui.ui.Text.numbers` as an abstract made both `k == "numbers"` branches vanish
from 3977 lines of emitted C++, the build succeeded without a word, and a
received `numbers` would have been dropped in silence.

That is failing *open*, which this page refuses two paragraphs above for a
different reason. A field carrying `@:winrt` has said it crosses to a WinUI
property; there is no reading of that under which saying nothing is right. An
unspellable type is now a compile error naming the field and its type, and
`kindOfType` follows an abstract to what it stands for — so a type that gives a
value its meaning (`nui.Numbers`, which reads as a `Bool` and travels as
`"tabular"`) crosses as what it really is.

The check that should have caught it was watching the wrong thing:
`TextStyleCheck` asserted the numeral *helper* was in the emitted C++, and the
helper is emitted unconditionally. It asserts the two dispatch branches now. A
helper nobody calls is the same shape as a declaration nobody reads.

### A colour modifier reaches the property that draws it

`wui_node_modifier` ignored the whole chain and said so to the debugger: *wui
has properties, not modifiers*. True as a sentence about the architecture, and
wrong as a decision — `backgroundColor` IS `Background`, under two names, and
the node path already knew how to set that on whatever control a handle holds.

So a TAKE button carrying `backgroundColor: role:accent` stayed grey, and
`brushFromRole` — written, correct, checked as text on a Mac — was never called
for a view at all. Found on Windows, at the image, by the Farceur session.

The three colour modifiers are routed now: `backgroundColor` to `background`,
`foregroundColor` to `foregroundColor`, `border` to `borderBrush`. Anything else
is still reported, by name.

## Where children go

`wui_node_insert` receives a parent, a child and an index. WinRT has **four**
places a parent can keep a child, and which one applies depends on the parent:

| Parent | Children go to | Index |
|---|---|---|
| `Panel` (StackPanel, Grid) | `Children` | honoured |
| `TabView` | `TabItems` | honoured |
| `NavigationView` | `MenuItems` for a `NavigationViewItem`, `Content` for anything else | pane only |
| `SelectorBar` | `Items` | honoured |
| `Border` | `Child` | nothing to order |
| `ContentControl` | `Content` | nothing to order |

Handling only `Panel` and returning silently for the rest is what drew the
kitchen sink as a lone `+`: a TabView keeps its pages in `TabItems`, so every
tab was dropped, and WinUI renders a TabView with no items as nothing but its
add-tab button. A parent with nowhere to put a child now says so.

A row is a `Grid` and its children go into **columns**, `Auto` for content and
`*` for a spacer — a `StackPanel` hands each child the size it asks for and has
no leftover room to give away. A row and a `ZStack` are both Grids, so a row is
tagged and the tag is read back through `IPropertyValue`;
`unbox_value_or<hstring>` instantiates `IReference<hstring>`, which this header
set rejects.

## How a control answers back

A two-way control needs both directions, and the push path had neither until a
switch bound to a cell holding `true` drew itself `Off`.

**Down** — `wui.mui.FromViews` reads the bound cell while describing the tree,
and emits its value under whatever that control calls its value.
`wui.nui.Bindings` holds those names, because they are WinRT's: a switch calls
it `isOn`, a field `text`, a slider `value`. Reading the cell there is what
subscribes the render to it — the walk runs inside an effect.

**Up** — the control reports through the one event that carries its value, and
`wui_bridge_invoke_node_{string,float,int,bool}` carries it into Haxe. The value
is read off the event's **sender**, never off a captured control: capturing
would make the control own a handler that owns the control, a cycle WinRT has
no collector to break.

**Never re-assert a value a control already has.** A two-way control is written
by the user, then written again by the render that the user's own edit
provoked — the same value, a moment later. WinRT does not treat that as a
no-op: assigning `Text` moves the caret and assigning `IsOn` cuts the switch
animation off mid-slide. Both read as the control being rebuilt under the user's
hands, which is what push mode exists to avoid. `Text`, `IsOn` and `Value` are
compared before being written.

## Numbers, and which entry point they arrive through

A number does not know which of the two it is. Haxe answers
`Std.isOfType(1.0, Int)` with `true`, so a describing layer holding `Dynamic`
sends `max = 1.0` through the **integer** entry point. Each entry point used to
carry branches only for properties declared its own kind, so that call found
nothing and vanished — silently, and three defects came from it: a slider that
kept WinUI's default maximum of 100 and drew 0.4 pinned to the left, stack
spacings that never arrived because they are whole numbers, and a progress ring
one control over.

Which C type a number crossed as is an accident of its value. What it has to
become is written on the member, so the two numeric entry points accept each
other's properties and convert. Strings and booleans stay matched exactly:
neither has a form the other can be mistaken for.

## One tree per surface

A mounted tree is a **surface record** — its own sink, reconciler, render
effect and `rui.Lifetime`, plus the root handle it reconciles into
(`wui.nui.SurfaceRecord`). The Primary surface holds the *application's*
lifetime, because its render passes bracket `body()`, where the app's `keep`
keys are declared; a later surface (an auxiliary window) brings a fresh one.

Roots are **registered, not hardwired**: `BuildUI` calls
`wui::nodes::registerRoot(root)` and passes the handle it gets back to
`wui_bridge_render_nui(int)`. It used to be a literal `0` on both sides, seated
by a `reset()` that cleared the whole handle table first — fine with one
window, and a wipe of every other surface's controls the moment there are two.
The same rule now governs node callbacks: the registry is monotonic and never
wiped; a destroyed node's ids become holes, and a late event against a hole is
reported rather than routed to a stranger's closure.

Tearing a surface down is `SurfaceRecord.dispose()` — idempotent, releases the
render effect and the lifetime. `wui_bridge_dispose_primary()` is the
application-over seam: it disposes every auxiliary first (each releases its
own lifetime), then the Primary, whose lifetime carries everything the app
`own()`ed.

`test/MultiRootCheck.hx` pins all of this with two recording surfaces: an
update or destroy on one must leave the other's bindings, controls and
callbacks untouched.

## Auxiliary windows

A `@:surface(Auxiliary)` declaration on a mui app becomes a second WinUI
window, live — its own surface record, reconciled on its own state, in
declaration order (cardinality Many: N windows on the one UI thread is WinUI
3's normal shape, and the only thread hxcpp is attached to).

The layering is the hook pattern the sibling backends use: the bridge is wui
core and may not import `mui`, so `wui.mui.App`'s constructor installs
`HaxeBridge.auxiliaryRootsOf`, answering each declaration as a **node thunk**
(`FromViews.describe` runs in the thunk — the push path eats nodes, and the
conversion is the mui layer's business). `renderNui` mounts the auxiliaries
right after the Primary; `install()` constructed the app — and installed the
hook — before `BuildUI` ever ran, so the hook is always there.

Window creation crosses through a **slot**, not a symbol —
`wui_bridge_set_window_creator`, filled by `BuildUI`, consulted by the library
— so the hxcpp library stays linkable on its own, and a test injects a
counting creator on the Haxe side (`HaxeBridge.windowCreator`) without WinRT
existing at all. The generated `wui::nodes::createWindow` opens the Window,
registers a StackPanel root like any other surface's, and installs a `Closed`
handler that reports the handle to `wui_bridge_surface_closed`; the Haxe side
then disposes exactly that record. Closed windows are dead entries in a
pinned, never-shrinking window list — the handle-table policy again.

`test/AuxiliaryCheck.hx` drives the whole path as a real mui application with
the seam injected: one window per declaration, per-surface rebuilds, a close
that touches nothing else, and an application release that disposes the rest.

### ABI deltas for the next Windows validation pass

On top of the partition's list:

1. new slot in the hxcpp library: `wui_bridge_set_window_creator(int (*)(const char*))`,
   registered by the generated `BuildUI` before `wui_bridge_render_nui`;
2. new library export consumed by generated code: `wui_bridge_surface_closed(int)`,
   called by the `Closed` handler inside the generated `wui::nodes::createWindow`;
3. new generated function `wui::nodes::createWindow(const char*) -> int`
   (declared in `WuiNodes.h`, defined in `WuiNodes.cpp`, plus the pinned
   `g_windows` vector);
4. `wui_bridge_dispose_primary()` now tears down auxiliaries before the
   Primary — name unchanged, behaviour widened.

## Commands: the menu bar

A `@:surface(Commands)` declaration becomes a WinUI `MenuBar` — and the whole
design is that it takes **no new bridge machinery**: WinUI has no window-owned
menu, `MenuBar` is an ordinary XAML control, so `wui.mui.App.nuiBody()` injects
it as the first child of the Primary tree (a wrapping `VStack`). Ordinary nodes
mean the existing pipeline does everything:

- **N menus.** One `MenuBarItem` per CommandSet declaration, titled from the
  set id (one capital — the same rule as auxiliary window titles). SwiftUI's
  CommandsBuilder could not produce N menus from a runtime count; a XAML
  control can.
- **Live labels, free.** The command thunks are re-sampled on every describe,
  inside the render effect; a label that reads state re-applies as a `text`
  prop through the reconciler, on the same node, nothing recreated.
- **Clicks are Button's path.** A `MenuFlyoutItem`'s `Click` rides the same
  id-over-the-bridge route (`wui_node_prop_callback` grew a MenuFlyoutItem
  branch; same token slot — one node is one control, never both).
- **Chords.** The portable chord names the platform's *primary* modifier — on
  Windows that IS Ctrl, so `"ctrl+k"` maps literally (macOS maps the same
  chord to Command); `alt` is Menu, `shift` is Shift; keys are a letter, a
  digit, or `enter`/`escape`/`tab`. The grammar lives in `wui.mui.Chords`,
  where a test pins it without a Windows machine; one packed int
  (`modifiers << 16 | key`, Windows.System's own enum values) crosses under
  the undeclared prop key `accelerator`, and a hand-written branch in
  `wui_node_prop_int` unpacks it into a `KeyboardAccelerator` (Clear then
  Append — a re-render must replace, never accumulate). A chord outside the
  grammar keeps its item's label and click, said once: on a menu bar,
  discoverability survives the unparseable chord.

`test/MenuBarCheck.hx` pins the grammar, the described shape, the invoke, the
chordless and unparseable degradations, and the live label — by node handle,
so the re-apply is proven to land on the right node.

### ABI deltas, menu bar (same validation pass)

5. new create cases and generated setters for `MenuBar`, `MenuBarItem`
   (`Title`), `MenuFlyoutItem` (`Text`) — derived from the new `wui.ui.*`
   declarations, no hand ABI;
6. `wui_node_prop_callback`: `onClick` now also matches `MenuFlyoutItem`;
7. `wui_node_prop_int`: hand-written `MenuFlyoutItem`/`accelerator` branch
   (KeyboardAccelerator from a packed int; `#include <winrt/Windows.System.h>`
   added to `WuiNodes.cpp`);
8. `wui_node_insert`/`wui_node_remove`: two new places children live —
   `MenuBar.Items()` (MenuBarItem) and `MenuBarItem.Items()`
   (MenuFlyoutItemBase).

## What is still missing

The transpiled path's own state bridge does not push `TFloat` or `TBool` to the
UI — it says so at startup. That is the *other* path; nothing on this page
depends on it.
